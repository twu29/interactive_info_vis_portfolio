            This visualization shows time through movement, with a slower figure indicating minutes and a faster-moving figure outside the clock indicating seconds. 
            It is designed to help users intuitively perceive how time passes.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Context:</strong> This is for users who struggle with time awareness. It would be used as a metaphorical clock where different walking speeds represent seconds and minutes, helping users intuitively understand time flow.</li><br>
              <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> I chose a traditional clock layout with numbers and hands so users can immediately understand the current time without needing instructions. To help users build a better sense of time passing, 
                I added two moving figures: one walking inside of the clock to represent minutes and a faster-moving figure outside the clock to represent seconds, making abstract time intervals more tangible. 
                To make the experience more engaging and playful, I added an interactive feature where clicking on a figure causes it to fall.</li><br>
              <li><strong>Future work:</strong> In the future, I plan to make the human figures more expressive by adding different walking or running animations. I also want to introduce more interactive features, 
                such as allowing users to click on the figures to change their outfits, or decide whether to place them back on the clock to continue walking or let them sit on the clock. 
                These interactions would make the experience more playful and give users more control over how they engage with the visualization.</li>

          <p>
              This visualization presents time as something intentionally hidden rather than constantly visible.
              The current time is revealed only when the user interacts with the window blind, emphasizing moments of 
              checking time instead of continuous monitoring, and time is displayed in a 24-hour format.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Context:</strong> This visualization is designed for users who feel anxious or distracted by constantly checking the time, 
                such as students, creatives, or anyone who wants to focus without being overwhelmed by time awareness. 
                By hiding the clock behind a window blind, time becomes something the user chooses to reveal only when necessary, 
                encouraging more mindful and intentional engagement with time.</li><br>
              <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> I chose a window and blind metaphor to reflect how time exists in the background of daily life rather than demanding constant attention. 
                The blind automatically closes after three seconds, reinforcing the idea that time should not dominate the user’s focus. 
                A day and night theme based on the current system time provides additional temporal context without relying on numbers alone. 
                The pull string interaction makes the act of checking time feel physical and deliberate, transforming a routine action into a small, meaningful interaction.</li><br>
              <li><strong>Future work:</strong> In the future, I plan to add subtle environmental cues, such as changing weather or lighting conditions, to further communicate the passage of time 
                without explicitly showing numbers. I would also like to experiment with customizable blind style and behaviors, allowing users to control how long the time remains visible or choose 
                alternative visual representations of time.</li>

          <p>
                This visualization presents time as a playable experience rather than a countdown to watch. 
                Users set a focus duration, and time progresses through the motion of a record player. 
                As the record spins, a colored fill gradually expands across the vinyl surface, allowing users to see how much time has passed and how much remains without needing to constantly read numbers.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Context:</strong> This visualization is designed for users who want to stay focused while working or studying like students. 
                Traditional timers can encourage frequent checking and increase distraction, so this design offers a calmer alternative that communicates progress visually. 
                The record player metaphor supports sustained attention by keeping time awareness present but unobtrusive.</li><br>
              <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> I chose a record player metaphor because it naturally represents duration, continuity, and progress, when a record plays, time moves forward. 
                The spinning motion reinforces that a focus session is active, while the expanding color fill on the vinyl provides an intuitive sense of elapsed and remaining time. 
                A percentage displayed at the center offers precise feedback for users who want clarity, while the overall visual remains readable at a glance. 
                Start, pause, and reset control buttons allow users to adapt the timer to real focus patterns rather than enforcing a rigid workflow.</li><br>
              <li><strong>Future work:</strong> In the future, I plan to add preset focus modes such as Pomodoro or longer deep-work sessions, along with optional audio feedback like a soft start sound or a gentle cue when a session ends. 
                I also want to explore more expressive visual effects to make the record player feel more personal and customizable. Eventually, I imagine a small “record library” where users can see the sessions they’ve completed in the past, 
                helping them reflect on how much time they’ve spent focusing over time.</li>
